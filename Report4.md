This weekend our group is focus on running a live window for the test of our project. Window is the last step that we are working on. 
We already got everything in place. 

Here are the website I used to install a live window 10:

However, I still couldn't find the solution for it. 
Our team we're still working on it. 

My solution:
Install [Win10PE SE](https://www.afterdawn.com/software/system_tools/operating_systems/win10pe-se.cfm) to run a live CD on
Windows 10.

Step 1: 
Use this [page](https://www.afterdawn.com/software/general/download_splash.cfm/win10pe-se) to download Win10PE SE

Step 2: 
A window pop up after the installation is done, click accept for the process to complete 

Step 3: 
After the porcess completed, there is a survery to fill 

Step 4: 
It created a .zip file, drag this file to the CD 

Result:
